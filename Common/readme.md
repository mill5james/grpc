# Common Assets

This project contains the [Example.proto](./Example.proto) file and the .NET Standard project to build the common assets for the .NET Client and Server.

## Example.proto file

This is a very simple example of a [Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3) service definition for [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/). It includes a simple RPC call, a client streaming call, a server streaming call, and a bidirectional streaming call.
